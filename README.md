## ogre.tools

[ogre.tools](https://ogre.tools) is a free and open source virtual table top to help run your **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition** games. It is designed to be another tool in your dungeon master toolbox rather than an all-in-one solution. This application runs in your browser and relies exclusively on local storage to persist your uploaded maps, tokens, and the state of your workspaces.

This is a **work in progress** and not intended for serious usage at this time. It is under heavy development and will go through many more changes as it matures.

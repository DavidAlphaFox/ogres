## ogre.tools

[ogre.tools](https://ogre.tools) is a free and open source virtual table top to help run your **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition** games. It is designed to be another tool in your dungeon master toolbox rather than an all-in-one solution. This application runs in your browser and relies exclusively on local storage to persist your uploaded maps, tokens, and the state of your workspaces.

This is a **work in progress** and not intended for serious usage at this time. It is under heavy development and will go through many more changes as it matures.

### Design Goals
* Free and open source &ndash; forever.
* Tailored for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition games.
* No account registrations, sign ups, or third party authorizations.
* Runs entirely within your browser &ndash; no server necessary.
* Small number of well designed features.
* No rules engine or game data.

### Roadmap

  * Drawing shapes such as circles and rectangles
  * New options for token styles

  * Visibility controls such as a fog tool and hidden tokens
  * Improved intelligence when importing maps
  * Export and import application data
* Further Down The Line
  * Select and manage multiple tokens and shapes
  * Weather and color temperature effects
